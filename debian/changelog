libnss-cache (0.10.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Speeds up the name / uid / gid lookup in the nss-cache library.
    * don't search groups if the provided buffer is small enough that the
      chance of succeeding is small
    * create simple index structure with uniformly sized entries and
	  mmap/bsearch as a replacement for a heuristic binary search
    * if the entry was not found in the index, do not fall back to linear
      search; still fall back if the entry was outdated, not accessible or
      if a value was not found at the expected offset
    * replace strcoll with strcmp for checking equality of the index, as
	  the index is built based on a simple string sort
